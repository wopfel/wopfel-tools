How to use Twitter message:

1. Register new app https://twitter.com/apps
2. Put consumer key and consumer secret into OAuth example
   https://github.com/semifor/Net-Twitter/blob/master/examples/oauth_desktop.pl
3. Run OAuth example, load URL into browser, enter PIN into OAuth example
   Both access token and access token secret are stored in oauth.datafile - you can use the following two lines after "if ( @$access_tokens ) {" to show them:
   print "AT: $access_tokens->[0]\n";
   print "ATS: $access_tokens->[1]\n";
   and run outh_desktop.pl again
